\noindent Let $E$ be a set of {\em elements}. Let $S$ be a {\em
  selection}. A selection consists in a list $$S = s_{[n]}$$ where $n$
consists in the number of entries in the selection. An entry is pair
$s_i = (e_i, e'_{[k_i]})$, where $e_i \in E$ $e'_{k_i} \in E$.

Applying the {\em data} operator $d$ to a selection we generate
yet another selection with some extra stuff:

\begin{align}
&d(S,v_{[n]})\\
&d(S, f )
\end{align}

\begin{enumerate}
\item[{\bf [value-mapping-(1)]}] For every entry $s_i$, the following
  mapping is defined $ e'_j \mapsto v_j $ for $1 \leq j \leq
  \min{k_i}$. 
\item[{\bf [value-mapping-(2)]}] For every entry $s_i$, the following
  mapping is defined $ e'_j \mapsto f( v(e_j) )$ for $1 \leq j \leq
  \min{k_i}$. Where $v(e_j)$ is the current value associated to $e_j$
  in the current selection.
\item[{\bf [enter]}] The enter selection is an addictional selection
  $S'$ such that there it has a parent element, and an array of data,
  but no child element. The only operator on the enter selection should
  be append (which associated data right away). After the append is done
  the selection is merged back.
\item[{\bf [exit]}] Selection with elements and no data associated.
\end{enumerate}
